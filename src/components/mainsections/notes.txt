Ponder 
Ponder is a powerful tool designed to facilitate brainstorming and idea mapping. Having successfully utilized it in previous projects, I have dedicated my free time to continuously enhance its functionality. It is my pleasure to offer the code freely, allowing you to utilize and customize it according to your specific requirements and preferences.
