                         and mapping out ideas. I used it for some of my other
                         projects in the past. Ponder is a small project
                         that is currently being updated throughout free time.

                            github to see some of the commands I have created.
                            As of the momment, Discord is currently my favorite
                            and most comfortable area to program.

                            Atlas is my main project. The goal is to 
                            make it a brokerage that allows trading on either
                            the crypto or stock market. It also will have a 
                            simplicity of that makes learning about the stock
                            market easier. As of right now, it displays the crypto 
                            market to what is being traded and a learning section.
                            This is a multiyear project and one that has been worked on
                            since October 2021.
